# Spire Assault Helper

This tool is intended to help players with the Spire Assault minigame in the browser game Trimps: https://trimps.github.io

## How to use
Copy and paste your Trimps save file into the textbox in the upper left corner. The tool will then read your save file and create a simulation of what your current game file looks like.

By default, the helper will simulate 200 battles in Spire Assault with your current loadout and show you your current Dust per Second and which equipment will yield the highest improvement to your current game. 100% is the most efficient upgrade for your build.

You can also set the tool to simulate 500 or 1,000 battles. This will better stabilize the DpS and efficiency calculations but will take more time to calculate.

Finally, clicking the "Guess for better" button will make it run 100 random setups and it will equip the best set it found

Other than that, you can fiddle around with the SA simulation as if it was a real game.

## Known Issues
This tool is still in an early Beta so bugs abound.

*The tool does not reset if you add a new save file. Please refresh the page before loading another save file
*Tool adds dust based on outcome of simulations. It will print the wrong amount of dust
*I've only reach U2 z100 and SA 20 on my save file so I don't know what happens beyond that.
